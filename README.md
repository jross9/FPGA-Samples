# FPGA Examples

We all learn through examples. It's kind of like training an AI -- only after we have seen enough concrete examples of a concept do we begin to fully understand it. 

This is my site of FPGA / HDL examples.

# The PLAN

* Button   -- simplest example, we press a button and an LED turns on. Let go, it turns off.
* Button2  -- press a button and an LED turns on. Press button again, LED turns off.
* Switches -- second simplest example, turn a switch ON LED goes on, turn it OFF LED goes off.
* [Blinky](040-Blinky)   -- We merely blink a single LED at a given rate!  
* Blinky2  -- We blink all LEDs that the dev board has. 
* Sweep    -- Sweep a set of LED’s back-and-forth.
* Counter  -- Counter show result in binary on LED's
* 7Seg     -- Counter show result on LED segments
* PS2      -- Read PS/2 keyboard
* PS2M     -- Read PS/2 mouse
* UART     -- UART example (echo char)
* ROM      -- 
* RAM      -- 
* VGA      -- Set screen color to set of three switches (8 colors) 
* VGA2     -- Create a grid in each of several VGA modes ... 
* DVI      -- 
* HDMI     -- 
* CPU      -- 6809 Free-Run
* CPU1     -- 6809 Simple ROM
* Logic    -- TTL Logic Family
