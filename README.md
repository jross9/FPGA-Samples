# FPGA Examples

We all learn through examples. It's kind of like training an AI -- only after we have seen enough concrete examples of a concept do we begin to fully understand it. 

This is my site of FPGA / HDL examples.

# The PLAN

010-Button   -- simplest example, we press a button and an LED turns on. Let go, it turns off.
020-Button2  -- a button and an LED turns on, press button again LED turns off.
030-Switches -- second simplest example, turn a switch ON LED goes on, turn it OFF LED goes off.
040-Blinky   -- We merely blink a single LED at a given rate!  
050-Blinky2  -- We blink all LEDs that the dev board has. 
060-Sweep    -- Sweep a set of LED’s back-and-forth.
070-Counter  -- Counter show result in binary on LED's
080-7Seg     -- Counter show result on LED segments
