# FPGA Examples

We all learn through examples. It's kind of like training an AI -- only after we have seen enough concrete examples of a concept do we begin to fully understand it. 

This is my site of FPGA / HDL examples.

* 1 x DE0-Nano-SoC
* 3 x DE1 
* 1 x DE1-SoC 
* 2 x DE2
* 1 x DE2-70
* 1 x DE10-Lite
* 2 x DE10-Nano
* 1 x QMTech Cyclone IV EP4CE15
