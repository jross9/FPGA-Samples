# FPGA Samples

We all learn through examples. It’s kind of like training an AI – only after we have seen enough concrete examples of a concept do we begin to fully understand it. 

This is my site of FPGA / HDL examples.

Some good sites are:

* [ASIC-WORLD: Verilog](https://www.asic-world.com/verilog/index.html)
* [HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page)
