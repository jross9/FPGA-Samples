# Testbench

A testbench is a simulation of the logic circuit that you have defined in HDL. 

Testbenches are where it’s at.  If you are serious about learning HDL then you really want to master the art of using the testbench.  

It’s through the proper use of testbench simulations that you will fully understand for certain how your non-trivial circuit operates.      

And using the testbench is one of the best ways to teach yourself HDL.
