# Internet Archive (iArch)

My local archive of samples and examples found on the internet.  Curated to a certain degree and verified working by me.

Each one will have its own folder and README that tells where I found the original and links to it, along with notes from me if the original is not clear enough. Also in the folder, I will save the original d/lâ€™ed zip file.
